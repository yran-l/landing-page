								<td><b>Who I am</b></td>	
								<p>Hi! I am currently a rising senior in Brooklyn Technical High School in the Software Engineering major. If you prefer to read about my more technical side, please refer to my 
									<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hahXJjrgdkvGtn_UT6ssHRT5IQ_fG2a9/view?usp=sharing">resume</a> or my <a href="#work">portfolio</a>. 
									The picture attached above is my beloved dog, she'll be turning 6 this year. It also showcases my ranks in the games that I play, and the languages that I have coded in. My many hobbies consist of sleeping, eating, and occasionally playing video games.
									Although I have such boring hobbies, I take pride in taking risks and trying new things. Such as trying side hustles like reselling amd investing in stocks.
								</p>
								<td><b>My Inspirations</b></td>		
								<p>
									I've played video games since the age of six, I always loved the fact that I could virtually connect and have fun with people that I have never seen before.
									Also, being able to basically disconnect from reality for a short while was a driven factor on why I liked it. Due to this, ever since I've been drawn to the idea of computers
									and through that I find it interesting exploring how things that I use, work.

								<td>Project Intern ( 04.8.24 - 05.23.24 )</td>		
								<p>During this time frame, we have conducted research on how to implement a standardized official transcript system that could be used among all NYC schools. We then pitched 
									my team's idea to all the high-ranking officials of DIIT.
